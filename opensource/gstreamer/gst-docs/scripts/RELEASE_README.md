# GStreamer documentation

This is the released version of the [GStreamer documentation](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-docs), it contains
two folders:

* html/: The static website documentation which can be hosted anywhere and
         read in any web browser.
* devhelp/: The documentation to be browsed with [devhelp](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Devhelp).
            The content of that folder should be installed in `/usr/share/gtk-doc/html/GStreamer-@GST_API_VERSION@/`
            by documentation packages.
